You have a great idea: a gigantic, life changing, world changing idea! You are ready to bring it to fruition. What is the first step!?

The first step probably involves distilling your idea into a set of documents. Describing it as clearly, and in as much detail as possible. Eli has written hundreds of requirements and specification documents. He knows the secret to writing amazing requirements. 

It sounds cliche, but Eli knows that to write the best requirements you have to **tell a story**. A requirements document needn't detail every single facet of the technical workings of a new product or service &mdash; many of these implementation details are best left to the developers &mdash; the role of a requirements document is to clearly articulate the "goal," so that the developers are able to break the project into component pieces, focused on accomplishing the goal. Completing the story.
