Writing code is fun. Writing words can be tedious. Eli loves the challenge of communicating complex technical details as simply and clearly as possible.

Throughout his career Eli has written thousands of pages of technical documentation, including user manuals, training guides, and API documentation. 

It doesn't matter if you need someone to write documentation for your amazing new social network, or a training manual for the summer camp you are starting. Eli can work with you to distill your expert knowledge into a readable, perhaps even enjoyable, package.
