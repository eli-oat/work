By day [Eli Mellen](https://eli.li) works as a software developer responsible for web development and quality assurance testing (among some other things).

By night Eli Mellen is a nerd who likes to spend time with his family, go to the gym, play board games, and read. His hobbies include but aren't limited to hiking, biking, cooking, watching his son and wife play video games (he's not very good at playing them), and writing code.

Eli enjoys playing with Raspberry Pis, microcontrollers, JavaScript, TypeScript, Forth, Assembly, Emacs and a variety of other technologies.

Eli and his family live in Portland, Maine.
